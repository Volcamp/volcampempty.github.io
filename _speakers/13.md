I am a computer scientist with more than 10 years of experience in various fields ranging from web development to big data, including cloud computing and artificial intelligence. My experience combines technical and analytical aptitudes with problem-solving strengths to drive projects to on-time and high-quality completion.

I also have a Ph.D. in optimizing the performance of multi-tier distributed systems.

Currently, I am an Engineering Manager at JellySmack. We are the global creator company that detects and develops the worldâ€™s most talented video creators.

I love communicating and sharing knowledge with people ;) ( I also love sport and mountains ;) )

My motto in life is LIVE + LOVE + LAUGH :)
